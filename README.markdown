##FeedBee

####Background

Wouldn't it be great if review websites like Yelp broke down reviews into the specific good and bad things about a place? Users could then agree or disagree with these comments, and businesses could see what they're doing well, and what they could improve.

####Purpose

To demonstrate my ability to turn an idea into a product.

####Oops!
 The end goal of this app is to be able to review products, as well as places. However, the product side has not been implemented yet. This is why there is a polymorphic relationship that isn't being utilized.
